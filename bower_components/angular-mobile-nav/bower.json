Intended for mobile applications on Android/iOS.\n\nLicensed with MIT License.\n\nState of this Project (as of July 2013)\n-------------------------------\n\n* I will add no new features to this - only continue to maintain it.\n* I am currently working on and recommending another project for a more full scale app solution - [angular-jqm](http://github.com/opitzconsulting/angular-jqm) ([dicusssion](https://github.com/ajoslin/angular-mobile-nav/issues/48#issuecomment-20045650))\n* angular-mobile-nav will remain a good solution for a minimal mobile angularjs navigation library, with no frills or addons.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n* **Requires AngularJS 1.1.4+**\n\n* Include `mobile-nav.js` and `mobile-nav.css` into your page\n* Declare `'mobile-navigate'` as a dependency for your angular app: `angular.module('myApp', ['ajoslin.mobile-navigate']);`\n* Setup your routes as normal with `$routeProvider`.\n* Use the `$navigate` service to do your transitions, instead of `<a>` links.  Use `$navigate.go('/path')`, and `$navigate.back()`.  \n* You can erase history (eg when switching tabs) with `$navigate.eraseHistory()`\n* You can add transition classes of your own (check out the css file for how the current ones are done). There are three presets available: `slide`, `modal`, and `none`.  Use them in the `go` function, eg `$navigate.go('/path', 'modal')`.\n* Use the `<mobile-view>` element instead of the normal `<ng-view>`.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\n* To use the Makefile, install jshint and uglifyjs with `npm install -g jshint uglify-js`.\n* If you are on windows and can't use a Makefile, there's nothing else at the moment.\n* To get the demo to work, you first have to run `make`, then open the demo at `dist/index.html`.\n* When pushing a new build, go to the gh-pages branch and move the contents dist folder up one level (`mv dist/* .`)\n",
